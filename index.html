        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
        Renewable resources are the energy superheroes—they are power sources that may be used repeatedly without diminishing. Water, wind, and sunlight are a few examples of renewable resources. Imagine for a moment that we are in a race against the clock to determine how much of these resources we can save for later. The reason this competition is so important is that without renewable resources, we may be forced to rely on finite, non-renewable ones like coal and oil, which have negative environmental effects. Thus, we may make plans in advance to guarantee a sustainable future for our planet and ourselves by knowing how much sunlight, wind, or water we have left to harness.
<br>
The wonderful thing about renewable resources is that they have two purposes: they may be used for environmental preservation in addition to energy production. Unlike burning fossil fuels, we don't send harmful pollutants into the air when we use renewable energy sources like sunlight or wind. This will have a positive effect on ecosystems, reduce climate change, and clean up the air. Furthermore, since renewable energy may be produced locally, communities can become less dependent on imported energy sources and more self-sufficient. Thus, by emphasising renewable resources, we're safeguarding not just our homes but also the environment and our health.
<br>
The renewable resources have an impact on almost everyone on the earth, then! The availability of renewable resources affects everyone's life, from ordinary people like you and me to policymakers making decisions about energy policies. What a difference it would make to your town's environment, jobs, and electricity costs if your town could produce its own electricity using solar or wind power. Yet, it also affects future generations, not just the ones living now. We can guarantee our children and grandchildren a world as lovely and abundant as the one we inherited by making prudent use of renewable resources now.
<br>
To gain a deeper understanding of renewable resources, a great deal of work has been done in science and research. The amount of sunlight that reaches different sections of the planet, the speed at which wind blows in different places, and the volume of water that flows through rivers and streams are all topics of research for scientists. They collect data and forecast future resource availability using complex tools and methodologies. Decisions regarding where to locate renewable energy projects and how to invest in clean energy technology are made easier by this information for both businesses and governments. Consequently, the goal of this research is to influence how energy and the environment are used in the future, not only to collect data.
<br>
The motive for forecasting future renewable resource availability is complex and crucial to global sustainability initiatives. Renewable resources like sunshine, wind, and water provide cleaner alternatives to finite, non-renewable energy sources like coal and oil, reducing environmental damage and mitigating climate change effects. This transition to renewables promotes economic growth by creating employment and cutting long-term electricity costs.

The dataset acquired via web scraping includes population data for 2023 in a number of different countries, as well as supplementary columns that provide information on related demographic parameters like changes in the number of migrants. Web scraping has yielded data that includes about 230 rows of information and has provided light on historical global population trends. 
<br>
The website provided a dataset with data on how different countries have used renewable resources over the last five years.

Correlation matrix identifies relationship between numerical values in the dataset. There is a strong correlation between world share and population. Furthermore, there is a substantial relationship between fertility rate and yearly change.
<br>

By observing the distribution of points on the scatter plot, readers can see patterns or trends in the relationship between fertility rate and median age across the dataset's countries. When the fertility rate is low, the median age is higher.
<br>
